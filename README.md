# ContextSwitch

A Project that truly ballooned from where it started. The inital goal was to
create a simple program to understand how task switching works on a CPU. This
was complicated as to 'simplify' I decided to run it on a virtual CPU. This
lead to the creation of an assembler and we're already down a rabbit hole.

Additionally, I've written a small toy compiler to turn a small C subset into
assembly code. This is the first compiler I've written and as such it is
slightly odd and incredibly inefficent.

If there is enough time I may write a VHDL hardware implementation of this
architecture.
