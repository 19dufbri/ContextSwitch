# ContextSwitch

A Project that truly ballooned from where it started. The inital goal was to
create a simple program to understand how task switching works on a CPU. This
was complicated as to 'simplify' I decided to run it on a virtual CPU. This
lead to the creation of an assembler and we're already down a rabbit hole.

Since I'm crazy I think I'd be fun to try to write a toy compiler for this
virtual machine by the end. Additionally, if there is enough time I may write
a VHDL hardware implementation of this architecture.
